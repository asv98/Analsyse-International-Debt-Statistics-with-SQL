# Analzye International Debt Statistics with SQL

This project involves experimenting with SQL queries to analyze international debt data from The World Bank. The dataset provides information on the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across various categories. It includes national and regional debt statistics for multiple countries from 1970 to 2015.

The goal is to answer insightful questions about international debt using SQL queries. Some examples of the questions you can explore include:

What is the total amount of debt owed by the countries in the dataset?
Which country has the highest debt amount, and what is that amount?
What is the average debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?
